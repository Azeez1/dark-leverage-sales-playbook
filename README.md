# DARK Leverage Sales Playbook

This repository contains a very small prototype for the interactive sales playbook described in the prompt.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start a simple server. The `npm start` command will bundle the React code with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and then serve the `public` directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `public/index.html` in your browser.

The prototype currently implements a basic broker income calculator using React and Tailwind via CDN.
